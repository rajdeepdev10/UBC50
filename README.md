UBC50 is a chrome extension which provides a dashboard with a clock, weather, and a todo app.
The dashboard comes with a University of British Columbia Theme.
Besides the user's local time and weather, UBC50 also provides current time and weather data for Vancouver, BC.
This project is my final project for Harvard University's CS50x Curriculum.

### Project Inspiration
This project is inspired by the [Momentum](https://momentumdash.com/) chrome extension.

### Tech
UBC50 uses a couple of opensource projects:
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Only used for a couple of lines of code in the Todo app to dynamically select a class
* [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/) - Uses the API to receive weather data
* [Wallpaper Flare](https://www.wallpaperflare.com/) - For some of the background images.

### Installation
UBC50 Requires a Chrome Web Browser to run. The steps to install are to download this repository and install it directly in the browser after enabling developer mode.
